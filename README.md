# Hey there, I'm Chris
Welcome to my GitHub. I'm a teaching faculty member in Computer Science and Mathematics, where I combine logic, creativity, and a lot of debugging to help students explore the world of tech and problem-solving.

I earned my B.S. in Mathematics from **Michigan State University** in 2021 - go green! Since then, I've found my passion in education, working with high school students and helping them develop technical skills and critical thinking.

Outside the classroom, I mentor my school's **FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) Robotics** teams - we're currently running **6 active teams**! I help manage shared code resources, guide students through autonomous routines, sensor integration, and drive optimization. You can check out the shared [FTC Robot Controller repository](https://github.com/SharylandRobotics/FtcRobotController-IntoTheDeep) that we use across our teams

Here on GitHub, you'll find a mix of:
- Classroom resources and curriculum projects
- Personal and professional coding experiments
- Tools and snippets that help automate or streamline teaching
- Occasional robotics utilities or sensor code

I believe in open-source collaboration and using code to make education more engaging, accessible, and meaningful.

Feel free to poke around or reach out if you're into robotics, CS education, or just want to talk shop.

Thanks for stopping by!
